I am currently working for [Samsung Research America](https://www.sra.samsung.com) as a Senior Research Scientist. Previously, I was a member of
[Stanford AI Lab](http://ai.stanford.edu) at Stanford University as a postdoctoral research fellow under the advisory of [Dr. Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/). At Stanford University, I worked on building efficient convolutional networks in terms of run-time complexity, developing unsupervised and weakly supervised learning methods for better sample complexity in downstream tasks, generative models, and machine learning for computational sustainability. I earned my Ph.D in the [Chester F. Carlson Center for the Imaging Science](https://www.cis.rit.edu) at Rochester Institute of Technology under the advisory of Dr. [Matthew. J. Hoffman](https://people.rit.edu/mjhsma/index.html).
